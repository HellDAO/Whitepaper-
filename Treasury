HellDAO treasury is key to the protocol’s long-term growth and sustainability. By managing Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) and making strategic investments, the treasury strengthens the value of the HELL token.

---------------------------------------
Backing and Risk-Free Value (RFV)
The treasury boosts the backing of each HELL token by making smart investments. As the treasury grows, the token's backing strengthens, ensuring resilience against market fluctuations.

Treasury Growth from Protocol Fees
Every time users interact with HellDAO—whether through staking, bonding, or trading—a large portion of the fees is directed to the treasury. These ongoing contributions create a continuous flow of capital, allowing the treasury to reinvest and grow over time.

DAO-Managed Investments
All funds are governed by the community, with elected executors overseeing treasury decisions. This ensures transparency and allows users to influence how funds are invested to generate returns and grow the protocol.
