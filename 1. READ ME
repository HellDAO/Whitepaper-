SECURITY,

Is the team Doxxed?
It is useless and contrary to the crypto philosophy. 
First, giving you our Twitter accounts or leaking our IDs would have no value since you could easily think we did not send our true information even if we did. Moreover, we could easily send fake data that you could deem to be true. In both ways, you have no warranty of authenticity.
Second, Assure DeFi barely leaked scammers. A KYC rarely has legal consequences and can be faked. You would be wrong to think that doing a KYC would be proof of reliability and would ensure the trustworthiness of the project, knowing it can be falsified and that you would probably never have access to it, even in the worst cases.
Last, the two pillars of cryptocurrency are anonymity and transparency. We want to remain anonymous giving you the transparency you deserve. That's why we justified every decision we took regarding security. No decision has been taken randomly or thoughtlessly. It's necessary to remember that OHM Forks are degen projects. Yes, investing will always be risky and you cannot expect to have as many warranties as in a "centralized" project.
As you saw with FTX, doxxing doesn't prevent scams. The only real way we can show you how professional we are is through honesty, transparency, and the security measures implemented.
